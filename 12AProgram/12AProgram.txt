Description: A program that reads student exam data from a grades.csv file, calculates various statistics, and displays the results. The program uses the pandas and numpy libraries to read the CSV file, process the data, and print the statistics.

Variables created:
grades_df: 
	A DataFrame that stores the student data read from the grades.csv file.

exam_scores: 
	A numpy array that stores the numeric exam scores extracted from the DataFrame.

all_scores: 
	A flattened numpy array containing all exam scores for overall statistics calculation.

passing_grade: 
	A constant representing the minimum passing grade (60).

Logical steps:
1) Load the data from the grades.csv file into a pandas DataFrame (grades_df).
2) Print the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand its structure.
3) Extract only the exam scores from the DataFrame, converting them to a numpy array (exam_scores).
4) For each exam (column in exam_scores):
	a) Remove any NaN values.
	b) Calculate and print the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum scores.
5) Flatten the exam_scores array to create all_scores for overall statistics calculation.
6) Remove any NaN values from all_scores.
7) Calculate and print the overall mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum scores across all exams.
8) For each exam (column in exam_scores):
	a) Remove any NaN values.
	b) Determine and print the number of students who passed and failed.
9) Calculate and print the overall pass percentage across all exams.
