Description: A Python program that extends the Money class created in 10A. The program also includes a BankAcct class rewritten to extend the Money class and includes methods for depositing, withdrawing, and calculating interest. The program includes a test function to verify these operations.

Variables created:
	acct: Instance of the BankAcct class used in the test_bank_account function.
	Classes created:

	Money: This class extends the Decimal class and adds support for addition and subtraction operations. It also stores the units of 	the money.

	BankAcct: This class extends the Money class and includes methods for depositing, withdrawing, and calculating interest. It also 	stores the name, account number, and interest rate of the bank account.
	Functions created:

	__add__(self, other): This method in the Money class defines the behavior of the + operator. If the other operand is a Money 	object, it adds the two amounts and returns a new Money object. If the other operand is not a Money object, it adds the amount to 	this Money object’s amount and returns a new Money object.

	__sub__(self, other): This method in the Money class defines the behavior of the - operator. If the other operand is a Money 	object, it subtracts the other amount from this amount and returns a new Money object. If the other operand is not a Money object, 	it subtracts the other amount from this Money object’s amount and returns a new Money object.

	adjust_interest_rate(self, new_rate): This method in the BankAcct class adjusts the interest rate of the bank account.

	withdraw(self, amount): This method in the BankAcct class withdraws a certain amount from the bank account.

	deposit(self, amount): This method in the BankAcct class deposits a certain amount into the bank account.

	balance(self): This method in the BankAcct class returns the balance of the bank account.

	calculate_interest(self, days): This method in the BankAcct class calculates the interest over a certain number of days.

	test_bank_account(): This function creates an instance of the BankAcct class, performs the operations, and prints the results.

	main(): This function calls the test_bank_account function.

Logical steps:
1) Call the main() function.
2) Inside the main() function, call the test_bank_account function.
3) Inside the test_bank_account function, create an instance of the BankAcct class and perform deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation operations.
4) Print the results of the operations.
