Description: A program that creates a database called population_BL, inserts initial population data for 10 cities in Florida, simulates population growth for the next 20 years at a 2% growth rate, and visualizes the population growth for a selected city using matplotlib.

Variables created:

db_name: 
	A string representing the name of the database.
conn: 
	A connection object to the SQLite database.
cursor: 
	A cursor object to execute SQL commands.
cities: 
	A list of tuples containing the initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023.

Functions created:
	simulate_population_growth(): This function simulates population growth for the next 20 years at a 2% growth rate for each year and inserts the data into the population table.

	show_population_growth(): This function prompts the user to choose a city from the list of 10 cities and displays the population growth for the selected city using matplotlib.

Logical steps:
1) Create a connection to the SQLite database (population_BL.db).
2) Create the population table with fields: city, year, and population.
3) Insert initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023 into the population table.
4) Define the simulate_population_growth() function:
5) Loop through each city and simulate population growth for the next 20 years at a 2% growth rate.
6) Insert the simulated data into the population table.
7) Call the simulate_population_growth() function to populate the table with simulated data.
8) Define the show_population_growth() function:
9) Display the list of 10 cities and prompt the user to choose one.
10) Retrieve and plot the population growth data for the selected city using matplotlib.
11) Call the show_population_growth() function to display the population growth for the selected city.
12) Close the database connection.
