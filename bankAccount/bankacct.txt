Description: A Python program that simulates a bank account. The program creates a BankAcct class with methods for adjusting the interest rate, withdrawing and depositing funds, checking the balance, and calculating the interest over a given number of days. The program also includes a test_bank_account function to test the different methods in the BankAcct class and a main function to run the test function.

Variables created:
	name: The name of the account holder

	account_number: The account number

	amount: The initial amount in the account

	interest_rate: The initial interest rate of the account

Class created:
	BankAcct: This class encapsulates the entire bank account process. It includes methods for adjusting the interest rate, withdrawing and depositing funds, checking the balance, and 	calculating the interest over a given number of days.

Logical steps:
1) Initialize name, account_number, amount, and interest_rate in the __init__ method of the BankAcct class.
2) Use the adjust_interest_rate method to adjust the interest rate of the account.
3) Use the withdraw method to withdraw a certain amount from the account.
4) Use the deposit method to deposit a certain amount into the account.
5) Use the balance method to check the current balance of the account.
6) Use the calculate_interest method to calculate the interest over a given number of days.
7) Use the __str__ method to return a string representation of the account.
8) Use the test_bank_account function to test the different methods in the BankAcct class.
9) Use the main function to run the test_bank_account function.
