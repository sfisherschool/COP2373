Description: A Python program that reads student data from a grades.csv file and displays it in tabular format. The program uses the pandas library to read the CSV file and print the data.

Variables created:
	df: A DataFrame that stores the student data read from the grades.csv file.

Functions created:
	read_grades_from_csv(): This function opens the grades.csv file in read mode and reads the student data into a pandas DataFrame. It then prints the DataFrame, displaying the student data in tabular format.

Logical steps:
1) Call the read_grades_from_csv() function.

2) Inside the read_grades_from_csv() function, open the grades.csv file in read mode.

3) Read the student data from the grades.csv file into a pandas DataFrame and store it in the variable df.

4) Print the DataFrame df, displaying the student data in tabular format.
